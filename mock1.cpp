/*
Given a String S and String T. Find the Minimum number of time you have to concatenate 
S to have T as a subsequence.

More formally, find the minimum x such that S+S+... x timesâ€¦ + S contains T as a subsequence.

Eg:
S = abc
T = acb
ans = 2
abcabc

Eg: 
S = ababsed
T = abbsaeb
ans = 3
ababsedababsed
ababsedababsedababsed
